#  SwiftUI-Core-Data-Example
An example of adding core data to a swiftui project with CRUD operations

After watching and reading several things on the topic of CoreData and Swift I could not find a concise example of how to both implament CoreData in a SwiftUI project and to perform CRUD operations on that data. 

## Todo:
Still need to get update working. 


## Special Thanks: 
Special thanks to [@twostraws](https://twitter.com/twostraws) most of this code originated from [hackingwithswift.com](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/)

Special thanks to [@CodeWithChris](https://mobile.twitter.com/CodeWithChris) as well for his (CoreData YT series)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWurhFqTsPU] this sparked the idea to create this repo and setup the data to be shown.
